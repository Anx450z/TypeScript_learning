# Core Types of TS

* number : example = 1, 5.3, -10
* string : example = 'hello', "hello", `hello`
* boolean : example = true, false (0 is false)
* object : example = {age:30}
* arrays : example = [1,2,true, 'Ankur']
* tuple : example = [1,2] (immutable array with 2 elements)
* enum : example = enum{ NEW, OLD }
* any : example = can assign any type just like JS
* unknown : example = can assign unknown value, different than any
# Notes

* TS does not implement measures to catch errors during runtime when 
  compiled to JS. It is used to catch errors during development.
